todo:

* ask() should take starting position into account for local optimizer
* async_train_gp() --> train_gp_async()
* Make sure that very small or large values are rescaled, probably within fvgp
* Add examples for acquisition functions
* Are mean and objective functions defined as X --> R, or are they vectorized? Same is true for the kernel fuctions, X x X --> R or vectorized
* Add examples for the mean function
* Add great tests
* Constrained training
==============================
* many GP experts (started)
* manifold learning methods, learn distance measure for kernels
