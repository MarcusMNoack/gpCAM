todo:

* cost function should be comunicated to ask()
* Add examples for acquisition functions
* Are mean and objective functions defined as X --> R, or are they vectorized? Same is true for the kernel fuctions, X x X --> R or vectorized
* Add examples for the mean function
* examples for cost and cost update func
* Add great tests
* Constrained training
==============================
* many GP experts (started)
* manifold learning methods, learn distance measure for kernels
