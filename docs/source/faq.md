## What kind of data acquisition can gpCAM steer?

As long as there is an underlying parameter (or input) space and the data describes function values of a function defined across that space, gpCAM can be used. For instance, the taste of food dependent on the amount of salt, pepper and paprika would be "steerable". The fast majority of experiments and simulations are organized in such a way, and so gpCAM is useful.

## What operating system should I use?

While we always recommend linux, gpCAM is agnostic to the OS. All that is needed is a working python 3.7 (or newer) environment.

## What computing power do I need?

It depends a lot on your application. Data set sizes in the hundreds and several minutes to make a decision means you can use an old laptop. Data set volumes of 10000s and seconds for decision making needs a very good work station.
