# gpCAM API Levels

The user has two options to deploy gpCAM: by using the AutonomousExperimenter of the gpOptimizer.
Both come in single-task and multi-task versions. The AutonomousExperimenter is simpler to set up and implements a high-level
loop, while the GPOptimizer is a thin optimization wrapper around the fvgp package and inherits all of its capabilities, including
GPs on non-Euclidean input spaces and world-record-holding scaling of exact GPs.

To get to know gpCAM, check out the examples on this website, download the repository and go to "./tests", or visit the project [website](https://gpcam.lbl.gov/).
