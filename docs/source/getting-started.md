# Getting Started

Getting started with gpCAM is simple:

1. [Install the Code](installation.md).

2. Decide on the [level](read-the-docs.md) you want to run gpCAM on
   and check out the [documentation](read-the-docs.md) based on that decision.

3. Run your experiment or simulation autonomously! 

If you hit any roadblocks, read the documentation carefully, and have a look at
[common bugs](common-bugs-and-fixes.md). 

And if some particularly stubborn problems remain, contact [MarcusNoack@lbl.gov](mailto:MarcusNoack@lbl.gov)
